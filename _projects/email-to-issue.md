**Emails-To-Issue** is a Python script that takes incoming emails and automatically creates GitHub issues from them. This means you can have bugs, feature requests, or support messages sent via email turn into GitHub Issues without manually copying and pasting. This helps teams streamline workflows and capture feedback from any source that delivers email.
